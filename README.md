# Baking Recipes
This is the third app for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. I built this application from scratch.Some of the things I 

used for building this app are

* Fragments

* ButterKnife

* ExoPlayer

* Espresso

## Challenges
 
 * This was my first time using ExoPlayer,I had to dig in the documentation a lot to make it working.
 
 * I  created home screen widget for the first time for this app so I had to see a lot of tutorials and also documentation.
 
 * Running Espresso test was also a bit challenging.
 
 All in all I learnt a lot doing this project,I am more confident in my skills as a developer after doing this project.
